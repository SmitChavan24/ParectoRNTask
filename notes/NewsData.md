NewsData.io - Best for new users as it comes with a News search feature (just like the google search bar) that allows users to search for any news/article by just putting the topic or keyword. you can use it for free which allows you to make 200 requests per month.
NewsAPI - Very easy-to-use News API that can easily integrate with your project to use it.
Mediastack - simple and free REST API that allows you to access real-time blog articles and live news worldwide.
NewscatcherAPI - is another good option you can consider for your requirement.
A few of them have been useful to me, including newsdata.io and Newsapi. If you are not satisfied with these APIs, explore other APIs.

Thanks.
